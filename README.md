Welcome to your new TanStack Start app! 

# Getting Started

To run this application:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

# Building For Production

To build this application for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Testing

This project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for testing. You can run the tests with:

```bash
pnpm test
```

### Import pipeline

- **Unit tests** (no API keys): `tests/convex/lib/linkedin/mapToProfile.test.ts` and `normalizePrompt.test.ts` cover mapping and LLM response parsing. Run with `pnpm test`.
- **E2E (test mode, no API keys)**:
  1. Set `PIPELINE_TEST_MODE=true` in **Convex Dashboard** → your project → **Settings** → **Environment Variables**. (Actions run in Convex’s environment; `.env.local` is not used when you run the action from the Dashboard.)
  2. Run Convex dev: `pnpm dlx convex dev`.
  3. Create an organization in the Dashboard (Data → `organizations` → Add document) and note its `_id`.
  4. Seed test queue: Functions → run `importQueue.seedTestQueue` with `{ organizationId: "<org_id>", count: 3 }`.
  5. Run the pipeline: Functions → `importPipeline.processImportQueue` → Run with `{}`, or wait for the 15‑minute cron.
  6. Check Data → `importQueue` (rows should be `done`) and `profiles` (3 test profiles). Then unset `PIPELINE_TEST_MODE` for real imports.
  7. If rows stay **processing** (e.g. action failed before updating them): run `importQueue.resetStuckProcessing` with `{}` (or `{ organizationId: "<org_id>" }`) to set them back to **pending**, fix the env var above, and run the pipeline again.
- **E2E (real APIs)**: Set `LINKDAPI_API_KEY` (and optionally `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), leave `PIPELINE_TEST_MODE` unset. Add queue items via `importQueue.createMany` or your app, then run `importPipeline.processImportQueue` or wait for the cron.

## Styling

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

### Removing Tailwind CSS

If you prefer not to use Tailwind CSS:

1. Remove the demo pages in `src/routes/demo/`
2. Replace the Tailwind import in `src/styles.css` with your own styles
3. Remove `tailwindcss()` from the plugins array in `vite.config.ts`
4. Uninstall the packages: `pnpm add @tailwindcss/vite tailwindcss --dev`

## Linting & Formatting

This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting. The following scripts are available:


```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm format
pnpm check
```


## Setting up Convex

- Set the `VITE_CONVEX_URL` and `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` environment variables in your `.env.local`. (Or run `pnpm dlx convex init` to set them automatically.)
- Run `pnpm dlx convex dev` to start the Convex server.


## Shadcn

Add components using the latest version of [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button
```


## Setting up Better Auth

1. Generate and set the `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` environment variable in your `.env.local`:

   ```bash
   pnpm dlx @better-auth/cli secret
   ```

2. Visit the [Better Auth documentation](https://www.better-auth.com) to unlock the full potential of authentication in your app.

### Adding a Database (Optional)

Better Auth can work in stateless mode, but to persist user data, add a database:

```typescript
// src/lib/auth.ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { Pool } from "pg";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: new Pool({
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  }),
  // ... rest of config
});
```

Then run migrations:

```bash
pnpm dlx @better-auth/cli migrate
```



## Routing

This project uses [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) with file-based routing. Routes are managed as files in `src/routes`.

### Adding A Route

To add a new route to your application just add a new file in the `./src/routes` directory.

TanStack will automatically generate the content of the route file for you.

Now that you have two routes you can use a `Link` component to navigate between them.

### Adding Links

To use SPA (Single Page Application) navigation you will need to import the `Link` component from `@tanstack/react-router`.

```tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";
```

Then anywhere in your JSX you can use it like so:

```tsx
<Link to="/about">About</Link>
```

This will create a link that will navigate to the `/about` route.

More information on the `Link` component can be found in the [Link documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/framework/react/api/router/linkComponent).

### Using A Layout

In the File Based Routing setup the layout is located in `src/routes/__root.tsx`. Anything you add to the root route will appear in all the routes. The route content will appear in the JSX where you render `{children}` in the `shellComponent`.

Here is an example layout that includes a header:

```tsx
import { HeadContent, Scripts, createRootRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  head: () => ({
    meta: [
      { charSet: 'utf-8' },
      { name: 'viewport', content: 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1' },
      { title: 'My App' },
    ],
  }),
  shellComponent: ({ children }) => (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <HeadContent />
      </head>
      <body>
        <header>
          <nav>
            <Link to="/">Home</Link>
            <Link to="/about">About</Link>
          </nav>
        </header>
        {children}
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  ),
})
```

More information on layouts can be found in the [Layouts documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/routing-concepts#layouts).

## Server Functions

TanStack Start provides server functions that allow you to write server-side code that seamlessly integrates with your client components.

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'

const getServerTime = createServerFn({
  method: 'GET',
}).handler(async () => {
  return new Date().toISOString()
})

// Use in a component
function MyComponent() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState('')
  
  useEffect(() => {
    getServerTime().then(setTime)
  }, [])
  
  return <div>Server time: {time}</div>
}
```

## API Routes

You can create API routes by using the `server` property in your route definitions:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { json } from '@tanstack/react-start'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/api/hello')({
  server: {
    handlers: {
      GET: () => json({ message: 'Hello, World!' }),
    },
  },
})
```

## Data Fetching

There are multiple ways to fetch data in your application. You can use TanStack Query to fetch data from a server. But you can also use the `loader` functionality built into TanStack Router to load the data for a route before it's rendered.

For example:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/people')({
  loader: async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://swapi.dev/api/people')
    return response.json()
  },
  component: PeopleComponent,
})

function PeopleComponent() {
  const data = Route.useLoaderData()
  return (
    <ul>
      {data.results.map((person) => (
        <li key={person.name}>{person.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

Loaders simplify your data fetching logic dramatically. Check out more information in the [Loader documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/data-loading#loader-parameters).

# Demo files

Files prefixed with `demo` can be safely deleted. They are there to provide a starting point for you to play around with the features you've installed.
